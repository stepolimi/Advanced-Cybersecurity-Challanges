For this challenge I noticed that after the registration and login, on the website, there was the possibility to download and upload a serialized object. 
Looking at classes in the data file, I noticed that there is the class Challenge never used that in particular has a method "stop" automatically called by the "__destruct" method that executes the command in "stop_cmd". 
Another good thing is that when we upload a file, it is unserialized without any checks, so instead of uploading a User object I created a serialized Challenge obect with "cat /flag.txt" as value of the variable stop_cmd and then I uploaded it and got the flag.

This is the crafted Challenge object that I used:
O:9:"Challenge":4:{s:4:"name";s:4:"test";s:11:"description";s:6:"a test";s:9:"setup_cmd";N;s:8:"stop_cmd";s:13:"cat /flag.txt";}
