---------------------mitigation challange1------------------------------
canary: Attention! all the canaries has a 0 at the beginning so we cannot make it print totally to leak it
but we need to leak it from the second number and then add a 0 (there could be other zeros in the canary, just skip them and watch the next byte).

canary ALWAYS have a leading 0.

x /38gx  0x7fffffffde50   --> what is in the memory


for the other challanges with a canary wxcept the first one we need to leak more than only the canary
