when we have libc on the main, probably we are gonne use it.

-----------find the main when the compiler doesn't find it (with libc)-------

libc start main: lib c function called by the main. One of the parameters of start main is actually the main, but sometimes ghidra does not autamatically shows those parameters.
to make them show just change the signature of libc_start_main by adding (int* param1, int* param2, int* param3). If nothing shows up, check the usage of the function because it could be only a wrapper and follow the references to find the actual entry point.
The actual main will be a light blue FUN as a parameter of the libc_start_main.
