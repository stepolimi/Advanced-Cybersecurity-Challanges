some gdb commands:
	x /10gx 0x7fffffffbd10		reads what's inside
	
	[disasm] part disassemble the next instruction (if possible)

	[backtrace] part looks at saved ip (function that called us) (also obtained by command bt)
	
	break main adds a breakpoint in function main
	can look up at the address where I want to place a breakpoint from ghidra and with command b *0x0040987

	x /20gx 0x7ffffde30  --> asking 20 elements of size 8 (g) in exadecimal (x) from 0x7ffffde30

	x /20gx 0x7ffffde30 + 1000  --> shows 20 elements at the address + 1000

	x /20s 0x7ffffde30   --> asking 1 elements in string at the address
	
	ni   --> next instruction (does not enter in functions)
	
	vmmap  --> prints memory layout of the program

	finish -> end the function
	
	x /04wx addr  --> check what is inside

	x /1gx addr --> print in hexa 64 format
	x /1wx addr --> print in hexa 32 format
	x /1s addr --> print in string format
	x /1c addr --> print in character format
